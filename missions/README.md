# Grammar Spy Mission Content

All curriculum content is organized as **missions** and indexed by `/missions/manifest.json`.

Current sample missions:

- `past-simple/level1.json`
- `mixed-past/level2.json`

Reserved mission tracks (add level JSON files as needed):

- `past-continuous/`
- `present-vs-continuous/`
- `narrative-tense-control/`

Use mission IDs that remain stable across updates so progress history and recommendations keep working.
