# Grammar Spy™ Sound Placeholders

These files are placeholders for production sound replacements.

Expected replacements:

- `soft-click.placeholder` -> `soft-click.wav`
- `correct-chime.placeholder` -> `correct-chime.wav`
- `fail-tap.placeholder` -> `fail-tap.wav`
- `drag-whoosh.placeholder` -> `drag-whoosh.wav`

Current implementation (`games/timeline-intercept/timeline-intercept-sound.js`) uses synthesized fallback tones to keep the game functional without external libraries.
