      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What grammar activities work best for whole-class instruction?</h3>
        <p>
          Short mission rounds with one clear objective tend to work best. Teachers can model a round,
          run student turns, then debrief mistakes quickly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are online grammar games effective for middle and high school students?</h3>
        <p>
          They are most effective when games are paired with explicit goals and review. Grammar Spy is designed
          for this structure, not random play.
        </p>
